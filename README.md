## Project Overview

I created a **single-page (clone) website** using:
- **React.js**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Locomotive Scroll** (for smooth scrolling)
- **GSAP** (for animations)
- **React Icons** (for icons)

The website is deployed on **Netlify**. 🚀👨‍💻

Web development and design can be challenging 👍, but it’s also a lot of fun 😉. Enjoy the process, and don’t be afraid to experiment and try new things! **Happy coding!** 🌟🚀

I built this project by following tutorials from YouTube (**@Sheryians Coding School**). Learning from online resources can be incredibly valuable!
